Stoke
=====

Skeleton for an Ember.js app served by node from Heroku and backed by Parse, Firebase, or other platform services. 

Key Features:

* Cache Busting on deploy -- css and js assets are recompiled and renamed with a hash generated from their contents in the deployment process.
* Adapters for Parse or Firebase are generated from environment variables -- no need to commit api keys to your repo.
